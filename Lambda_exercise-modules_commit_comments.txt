Lambda function 'exercise-modules' calls functions in module
'mini.py' that call functions in 'pyfuncs.py' and was created as
a script to facilitate debugging.

Log file 'Expected-Lamda-Function-Execution-Result' contains
output that will be similar to the Lambda function 'Execution Result'
because the same functions are called and in the same order in both
'lambda handler()' and 'main()'.

Output will be much more meaningful if run on a system that is not
in the UTC or GMT timezone.

Layer 'layer-mini-pyfuncs-requests' contains mini.py, pyfuncs.py and 
requests which are required by the Lambda function.3gg
